For the weather website, napervilleweather.net, this repository holds
the php scripts that generate the web pages.

The scripts came from the saratoga-weather.org website.  I added my own customizations.

Added Space Weather from http://www.642weather.com/weather/scripts-space-weather.php

Added Google Analytics to top.php

Added Weather Underground Historical Data page from jcweather.us using http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/wxwuhistory.zip

Added El Dorado Weather NOAA Animated Ridge Radar Script http://www.eldoradocountyweather.com/scripts/weather-scripts.php
 - I customized it for Chicago

Added Air Quality from http://relayweather.com
 - http://www.relayweather.com/downloads.php
 - pulls data from http://www.airnow.gov/

Added CWOP CWOP Statistics Viewer from  http://relayweather.com
 - http://www.relayweather.com/downloads.php
 - scrapes content from http://weather.gladstonefamily.net/
 - Thanks to PHillip Gladstone!

Added river levels for the Chicago River
 - http://eastmasonvilleweather.com/downloads.php
 - content from Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service http://water.weather.gov/ahps/
 - Thanks to Dennis at East Masonville Weather 
 - in ./River directory is a README with a crontab script, runs every 15 minutes

Added support for WXSIM.  
 - just tweaked a line in Settings.php
 - every 6 hours a new plaintext.txt file gets uploaded
 - a "WXSIM" references shows on the home page and under the forecast menu
 - on my weather PC, I added WXSIM, WXSIMATE, and WRET. 
 - I also added a new scheduler ($30): http://www.splinterware.com/download/index.htm
 - The scheduler wakes up WXSIMATE, collects data, wakes up WXSIM, generates a forecast, plaintext.txt
 - fling uploads it to my home directory
 - The wxstatus page detects whether the plaintext file is fresh
 - Thanks to  Tom Ehrensperger for customizing my setup

Added support for 3in1
 - http://www.nordicweather.net/downloads/?2  version 4.1
 - Thanks to Henkka at Nordic Weather for all the hard work AND creativity
 - Setup tips found here: http://www.weather-watch.com/smf/index.php/board,56.0.html
 - http://napervilleweather.net/wxsim3in1/wxall.settings.php:
$wxallmainfolder = '';   <- for use with wxsim3in1/sivu2.php testing
$wxallmainfolder = 'wxsim3in1/';
$wxallmainfolderfull = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/wxsim3in1/';
$plaintextfolderfull = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/';
$lastretfile = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/lastret.txt';
$plaintextfile = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/plaintext.txt';
# Graphicons. To Do: move these to my local server
$wxallwindicondir = "http://static.nordicweather.net/nordic/images/barbs2/";
$wxallicondir = "http://static.nordicweather.net/nordic/images/dotvoid_30/";
$timezone = "America/Chicago";      # Your timezone
$lat = 41.xxxx;
$long = -88.xxxx;
$timeFormat = "d.m.Y H:i";          # Timeformat
$updatehrs = array(7,11,15,21);       # Hours when wxsim runs
$uploadupdate = 25;                   # minutes past full hour for upload time
$puoms = array('Â°F','in','mph','in','in','mi');
$mainwidth = "625";     # to fit in saratoga template width


 - FYI: the files lastret.txt and plaintext.txt are generated by WXSIM/WXSIMATE/WRET running on my weather PC and uploaded every several hours.
 - create graphlog.txt and chmod it to 666; this file gets created/recreated by PHP scripts whenever the 3in1 page is rendered.  A JS-based script in the browser grabs this file, AJAX style, and then draws the graph pulling in the well known Highcharts library
 - on weather server, run WRET and verify setup matches wret.png
   -- I don't do soil
   -- I set F (not C) for temperature
 - created wxsim3in1.php from wxnewpage.php
 - Looks like width of 625 means 5 day forecast instead of squishing 7 days

Added Juneau County Weather's Forecast Compare for WXsim
 - http://jcweather.us/scripts.php
 - http://jcweather.us/forecast-compare.zip?1333311217
 - installed raw download files in home directory ~/public_html/saratoga/
