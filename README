For the weather website, napervilleweather.net, this repository holds
the php scripts that generate the web pages.

The scripts came from the saratoga-weather.org website.  I added my own customizations.

Added Space Weather from http://www.642weather.com/weather/scripts-space-weather.php

Added Google Analytics to top.php

Added Weather Underground Historical Data page from jcweather.us using http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/wxwuhistory.zip

Added El Dorado Weather NOAA Animated Ridge Radar Script http://www.eldoradocountyweather.com/scripts/weather-scripts.php
 - I customized it for Chicago

Added Air Quality from http://relayweather.com
 - http://www.relayweather.com/downloads.php
 - pulls data from http://www.airnow.gov/

Added CWOP CWOP Statistics Viewer from  http://relayweather.com
 - http://www.relayweather.com/downloads.php
 - scrapes content from http://weather.gladstonefamily.net/
 - Thanks to PHillip Gladstone!

Added river levels for the Chicago River
 - http://eastmasonvilleweather.com/downloads.php
 - content from Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service http://water.weather.gov/ahps/
 - Thanks to Dennis at East Masonville Weather 
 - in ./River directory is a README with a crontab script, runs every 15 minutes

Added support for WXSIM.  
 - just tweaked a line in Settings.php
 - every 6 hours a new plaintext.txt file gets uploaded
 - a "WXSIM" references shows on the home page and under the forecast menu
 - on my weather PC, I added WXSIM, WXSIMATE, and WRET. 
 - I also added a new scheduler ($30): http://www.splinterware.com/download/index.htm
 - The scheduler wakes up WXSIMATE, collects data, wakes up WXSIM, generates a forecast, plaintext.txt
 - fling uploads it to my home directory
 - The wxstatus page detects whether the plaintext file is fresh
 - Thanks to  Tom Ehrensperger for customizing my setup

Added support for 3in1
 - http://www.nordicweather.net/downloads/?2  version 4.1
 - Thanks to Henkka at Nordic Weather for all the hard work AND creativity
 - Setup tips found here: http://www.weather-watch.com/smf/index.php/board,56.0.html
 - http://napervilleweather.net/wxsim3in1/wxall.settings.php:
$wxallmainfolder = '';   <- for use with wxsim3in1/sivu2.php testing
$wxallmainfolder = 'wxsim3in1/';
$wxallmainfolderfull = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/wxsim3in1/';
$plaintextfolderfull = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/';
$lastretfile = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/lastret.txt';
$plaintextfile = '/home/weather/public_html/saratoga/plaintext.txt';
# Graphicons. To Do: move these to my local server
$wxallwindicondir = "http://static.nordicweather.net/nordic/images/barbs2/";
$wxallicondir = "http://static.nordicweather.net/nordic/images/dotvoid_30/";
$timezone = "America/Chicago";      # Your timezone
$lat = 41.xxxx;
$long = -88.xxxx;
$timeFormat = "d.m.Y H:i";          # Timeformat
$updatehrs = array(7,11,15,21);       # Hours when wxsim runs
$uploadupdate = 25;                   # minutes past full hour for upload time
$puoms = array('Â°F','in','mph','in','in','mi');
$mainwidth = "625";     # to fit in saratoga template width


 - FYI: the files lastret.txt and plaintext.txt are generated by WXSIM/WXSIMATE/WRET running on my weather PC and uploaded every several hours.
 - create graphlog.txt and chmod it to 666; this file gets created/recreated by PHP scripts whenever the 3in1 page is rendered.  A JS-based script in the browser grabs this file, AJAX style, and then draws the graph pulling in the well known Highcharts library
 - on weather server, run WRET and verify setup matches wret.png
   -- I don't do soil
   -- I set F (not C) for temperature
 - created wxsim3in1.php from wxnewpage.php
 - Looks like width of 625 means 5 day forecast instead of squishing 7 days

Added Juneau County Weather's Forecast Compare for WXsim
 - http://jcweather.us/scripts.php
 - http://jcweather.us/forecast-compare.zip?1333311217
 - installed raw download files in home directory ~/public_html/saratoga/

Tweaked forecast-compare files
 - advforecaset2.php:  make sure $fileName (~line 99) is right.  test http://napervilleweather.net/advforecast2.php.  Verify correct, not blank
 - fc-config.php: $fileLoc="" and $analdays=5
 - fc-LogTemps.php:
   -- create blank fc-temps.txt chmod 777
   -- if using VWS, be sure to setup testtags.php (see fc-readme.txt)
   -- if using VWS, make sure to include 
      $entry[0] = $maxtempyest;
      $entry[1] = $mintempovernight;
   -- and comment out code 33,36
 - create blank forecastAM.log and forecastPM.log, chmod 777
 - crontab

Fix Forecast.  NWS web page changed 7/3/12
 - advforecast2.php v3.04
 - http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/updates.php#updates
 - used file as is, over wrote old file; it seemed to work.  
 - Tested with WXSIM; seemed ok.
 - I hand editted the previous version:
96c96
<  $NOAAZone = 'CAZ513';  // change this line to your NOAA warning zone.
---
>  $NOAAZone = 'ILZ013';  // change this line to your NOAA warning zone.
98c98,99
<  $fileName = "http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Saratoga&state=CA&site=MTR&textField1=37.2639&textField2=-122.022&e=1&TextType=2";//
---
>  //$fileName = "http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Saratoga&state=CA&site=MTR&textField1=37.2639&textField2=-122.022&e=1&TextType=2";//
>  $fileName = "http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Naperville&state=IL&site=LOT&textField1=41.7626&textField2=-88.1543&e=0&TextType=2";

 - The above changes don't appear to be needed.  The defaults from the 
   settings file seem to cover

Fix http://napervilleweather.net/wxnoaagraphs.php
 - It was displaying NOAA no records found
 - Fixed wxnoaacsvdata.php at line 428:
//$wxsoftware = $SITE['WXsoftware'];
$wxsoftware = 'VWS';
 - I shouldn't have to do this. WXsoftware is set in Settings file
 - Hmmm...

Add a weather station sticker
 - http://scripts.anolecomputer.com/wxgraphic/
 - http://scripts.anolecomputer.com/downloads/wxgraphic_6.3.zip
 - copy wxgraphic directory to root folder, except for *.htx files
 - copy VWS_graphicstags.htx to c:\vws\root on weather PC.  Program VWS Internet / HTML to generate VWS_graphicstags.htm along with all the other templates.  Every 10 minutes is good.
 - copy arial.ttf from my PC's windows\font directory to wxgraphic dir
 - edit config.txt
$data_file_path  = '../VWS_graphictags.htm';
$font_file = './arial.ttf';

alt="Naperville Weather"
title="Naperville Weather">
</a>
 - add sticker reference to about page

Refresh to the latest version of the saratoga weather scripts  1/31/13
- I haven't touched the contents of the website in 6 months.
- I went to http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/updates.php
- I checked for updates since April 2012
- It very nicely packaged 56 updates, including images, php files
- Jammed into one line:
advforecast2.php ajax-dashboard.php ajax-images ajaxWCTwx.js alert-images cache check-fetch-times.php common.php flyout-menu.xml get-metar-conditions-inc.php get-nnvl-iod.php GR3-radar-inc.php header.php include-NOAA-reports.php menubar.php nws-alertmap.js nws-alerts-config.php nws-alerts-details-inc.php nws-alerts.php NWS-alerts_read_me.html nws-alerts-summary-inc.php nws-rssfeed.xml nws-shapefile.txt plaintext-parser.php quake-json.js quake-json.php radar-status.php README-20130123-134621.txt README-Base-USA-changes-2012-07-28.txt Settings.php thermometer.php WU-radar-inc.php wxadvisory.php wxgraphs.php wxindex.php wxnws-details.php wxquake.php 
- As near as I can tell, the biggest updates are 
-- nws alters ported from http://ww.weather.ricksturf.com (thanks Curly!)
-- an updated wxquakes set of scripts
-- and lots of bug fixes and performance improvements.  Since some of the scripts do screen scraping from other sites, the WX content is a moving target and the scripts here need tweaking.  All normal stuff
- All of this worked very smoothly for me, but it did take over a day.
- I recommend you install these files, one at a time.  If you are replacing an existing one, do a diff before copying in the new one.  

Apply a small update from saratoga weather scripts 1/15/13
- downloaded latest zip file: 20130214-082844PST-updates-Base-USA-VWS-plugin
- updated following files:
 common.php  flyout-menu.php  footer.php  include-style-switcher.php  top.php  wxssgauges.php
- looks like the updates set the stage for installing the new SteelSeries Guages
- after everything was applied, the gauges page was empty, so I read the contents of the wxssgauges.php file
- I am submitting this update and starting another one from sandysoft

Sandysoft Gauges 2/15/13
- wget http://wiki.sandaysoft.com/files/Steelseries/gauges-ss-v2-2-0.zip
- unzip gauges-ss-v2-2-0.zip -d gauges-ss-v2-2-0
- create ./ssg directory and copy the following files and directories:
css
images
scripts
gauges-ss-basic.htm  
gauges-ss-basic-inc.php  
steelseriesVWSjson.php
- configure
scripts/gauges.js
weatherProgram    : 2,       
imgPathURL        : '/vwsimages/',
realTimeURL_VWS    : 'ssg/steelseriesVWSjson.php',
steelseriesVWSjson.php:
$wflashDir = '../../WxFlash/Data/';
$ourTZ = "America/Chicago";
gauges-ss-basic-inc.php  comment out the following lines
<!--
  <script src="<?php echo $ssgDir; ?>scripts/windrose.js"></script>
  <script src="<?php echo $ssgDir; ?>scripts/RGraph.common.core.min.js"></script>
  <script src="<?php echo $ssgDir; ?>scripts/RGraph.rose.min.js"></script>
-->


- update menu sidebar flyout-menu.xml
<item wxonly="VWS" caption="Gauges" title="Realtime Weather Gauges and Graphes" link="wxssgauges.php"/>
-Note: the prior saratoga weather script update assumed that the gauges files were put in /ssg and it supplied the wxssgauges.php file.  Very helpful, and best to do gauges in the order I followed.
